A Software Synthesizer

HistoricHarpsichord is intended to allow the user to get a reasonably historical harpsichord sound from a MIDI USB keyboard.
It may need no setup (depending on your machine and what you have installed) and there are no controls that could result in
an  embarrassing silence or instrument when you press the keys. It was made by cutting down the GNU Denemo program.
